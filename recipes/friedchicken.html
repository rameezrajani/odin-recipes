        <p>
            I enjoy fried chicken because it tastes good and the best place to get fast food fried chicken if you don't want to make it is popeyes. 
            If you do want to make it here's a <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8805/crispy-fried-chicken/" rel="noopener norefferer">recipe</a> that may or may not be good.
